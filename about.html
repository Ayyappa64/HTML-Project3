        <h2>What is difference between the product and srevice-based companies</h2>
        <p><h3>Generally, product-based companies have a high potential for scalability, while service-based companies have limited potential for scalability. Product-based companies invest highly in research & development and marketing to
             create and sell the product, whereas service-based companies require a less upfront investment.</h3></p>
